# Exchange Rate Calculator
The website pulls the current exchange rate using fetch from [open.exchangerate-api](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/free).

I based this on a project from 20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript, Udemy course. The original project doesn't follow best accessibility practices by removing outlines, insufficient contrast on text, and no labels on inputs. I used the async await syntax with fetch instead of .then and textContent instead of innerText for updating element text. I used SASS instead of CSS and took a mobile-first approach. Recreated the logo as an SVG, then created a sprit with all SVGs.
